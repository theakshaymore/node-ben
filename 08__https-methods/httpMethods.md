The core difference between the HTTP methods **GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE** lies in their intended action on a resource, their **idempotency**, and whether they modify the server's state.

These methods form the essential foundation of **RESTful API design**.

## üöÄ HTTP Method Comparison

| Method     | Purpose/Action                                  | Safety (Side Effects)                            | Idempotent?        | Body Allowed?                |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **GET**    | **Retrieve** a resource or a list of resources. | **Safe** (Read-only, no change to server state). | **Yes**            | No (Body ignored).           |
| **POST**   | **Create** a new resource.                      | Not Safe (Changes server state).                 | **No**             | Yes                          |
| **PUT**    | **Update/Replace** a resource entirely.         | Not Safe (Changes server state).                 | **Yes**            | Yes                          |
| **PATCH**  | **Apply partial modifications** to a resource.  | Not Safe (Changes server state).                 | **No** (Generally) | Yes                          |
| **DELETE** | **Remove/Delete** a specified resource.         | Not Safe (Changes server state).                 | **Yes**            | No (Body typically ignored). |

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Breakdown

### GET: The Retriever üßê

- **Action:** Requests a representation of the specified resource. It's used solely for **reading** data.
- **Example:** `GET /users/123` retrieves the details for user ID 123.
- **Key Property:** It must be **safe**‚Äîmeaning it causes no side effects on the server.

---

### POST: The Creator ‚ú®

- **Action:** Used to **submit an entity** to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or, more commonly, **creating a new resource**.
- **Example:** `POST /users` sends new user data to be created.
- **Key Property:** It is **non-idempotent**. Sending the same POST request multiple times will result in the creation of multiple new records.

---

### PUT: The Total Replacement üîÑ

- **Action:** Replaces **all** current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content. Use PUT when you want to **update a resource completely**.
- **Example:** `PUT /users/123` replaces _all_ existing data for user 123 with the data provided in the request body.
- **Key Property:** It is **idempotent**. Sending the same PUT request multiple times leaves the resource in the exact same state after the first call as it is after the fifth.

---

### PATCH: The Partial Modifier ü§è

- **Action:** Used to apply **partial modifications** to a resource. It's used when you only want to update one or two fields without sending the entire resource object.
- **Example:** `PATCH /users/123` might only send a new email address, leaving the name and other fields untouched.
- **Key Property:** It's generally considered **non-idempotent** because the operation might depend on the resource's current state.

---

### DELETE: The Remover üóëÔ∏è

- **Action:** Removes the specified resource.
- **Example:** `DELETE /users/123` removes the user account with ID 123.
- **Key Property:** It is **idempotent**. Deleting a resource is the same whether you send the request once or ten times‚Äîthe resource will be gone after the first successful call.
